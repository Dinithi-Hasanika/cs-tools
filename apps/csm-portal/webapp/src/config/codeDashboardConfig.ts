/**
 * Whether the code approach to dashboard generation (the model writes the
 * dashboard as JavaScript: `/dashboard/my/new-code`) is on for this
 * deployment. It is phase 2 and off by default: phase 1 ships the JSON
 * approach only.
 *
 * Read from the runtime `window.config.DASHBOARD_GENERATE_CODE_ENABLED` key.
 * The backend (`POST /dashboards/generate-code`) and csm-ai-integration-service
 * (`POST /ai/dashboards/generate-code`) are gated by the same name, so one
 * value turns the feature on or off everywhere. Only `true`, or the string
 * `"true"` for platforms that inject config as strings, turns it on; any
 * other value (`"1"`, `"TRUE"`, `"yes"`, unset) is off. Off, the page's
 * route sends to the 404 page and its button is not rendered.
 *
 * Read at call time (not module load) so a test can set `window.config` per
 * case; the value is fixed for a real page load anyway.
